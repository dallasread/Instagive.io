Advertising for Square can be found on TV, online, and practically everywhere you go. It makes sense that they are becoming one of the biggest pay-per-swipe platforms in the industry. The only problem is they aren’t designed with charities in mind, they are designed for the merchant. 

Square’s primary business model is based around a point of sale, 2.75% pay-per-swipe transaction, which makes sense for businesses selling products and swiping credit cards on-site, but not for charities taking donations on-the-go or online.

Although Square’s pay-per-swipe rate may seem appealing, it is important to understand what it  means for your charity or non profit. A pay-per-swipe-transaction means that individuals have to be swiping their cards in person. While this might be great for making payments at your office or church, its not great for:

- mass donations during live events
- accepting recurring donations 
- receiving donations 24/7
- taking donations worldwide
- donor based mobile giving 

When it comes to charities, it is essential that you are able to accept payments and donations in person and not in person, or on-site and on-the-go. If you only have one or the other you are automatically limiting your donor options as well as the amount of donations you can receive. 

Simply put, if your charity or non profit is looking to accept donations, Square, is not the best option. What you need is a platform that allows you to accept donations anytime, anywhere from anyone. A platform that is designed and customized for charities and non profits. A platform that was built from the ground up thinking about what works best to increase giving and donations for your cause.
