Mobile credit card swiping has become a popular way to do business. It allows you to swipe customers credit cards on the spot using your smartphone without having to manually enter any information. With many companies only advertising their per-swipe pricing model rather than their per-manual entry pricing model, we thought it would be best to take the time and explain the difference. 

#### Manual vs Swiped 

If your ever reading over pricing [like this](https://squareup.com/ca/pricing), you’ll notice the difference in rates between the “keyed in/manual” rate and the “per-swipe” rate. This means that it costs more for you to manually enter your credit card information then it does to personally swipe your credit card. The question however, is why?

<!-- more -->

The answer is simple; there is more risk involved. Most all credit card processors require manual transactions to be priced higher because of the associated risk that could potentially  arise. 

With manual transactions, the credit card doesn’t have to be present in order for a transaction to be accepted. Considering this, the amount of risk involved is increased. With swiped transactions the credit card has to be present and the individual will be able to verify their signature if needed. This situation presents less risk. 

With this information in mind, credit card processors charge a higher rate for manual transactions. Considering the credit card processor isn’t able to tell if you have the card or not, they charge the same rate across the board for everyone. 

#### What type of transaction does Instagive use?

Currently, Instagive is completely manual based. To benefit your non profit or charity we have developed a system that is focused around the donor and not the merchant. With manual based transactions your organization will be able to process donations wherever and whenever. That means you can have donors key in their credit or debit card information in person and even when they are not.

#### What about the risk for my organization?

Instagive is based around the idea of giving without receiving and that isn’t as appealing to anyone looking to commit credit card fraud. Just based on this fact alone, we expect there to be less risk associated with manual entry transactions using our system.
