Generating more income for your church’s cause can sometimes seem like a difficult task. Whether your trying to fundraise for the next building project or your just trying to increase tithing, its never as simple as you would like it to be. 

When talking with Pastors of all types (Lead, Young Adult, Youth)  we’ve noticed that a common pain point among them is finances. Although many may have the resources needed to put their ministries into action, they struggle in acquiring the finances to facilitate it. 

While we don’t have a magic formula, we do have 5 proven methods that have helped other Pastor’s on their journey to reaching their church’s giving goals.  

### 1. Make Giving Convenient 

If the only option you have for giving is via your sunday offering plate then your not being as convenient as you can be to your givers. In many instances, givers want to be able to give in a way that tailors to their lifestyle. That means being able to give from the credit and debit cards that they use regularly, giving from the comfort of their home or whenever they simply feel inspired to do so. Setting up systems that allows giving to be convenient, eliminates any barriers to giving and shows that your willing to accommodate your congregation as well. 

### 2. Talk About Giving

Having a discussion about giving during the offering is a simple yet proven way to increase giving. Reminding people of the ways they can give is essential to this process. One way you can do this is by posting a slide or playing a video that directs people to the giving avenues available for your church. People also feel more inclined to give when they know where their money is going and what has come from their donations. By providing verbal and visual updates of the cause they have contributed to, you will remind people why they are giving and present a reason to continue giving to that cause. If your hush, hush about giving then people won’t take the time to think about it and they certainly won’t feel inspired to do so. 

### 3. Setup Recurring Giving 

Setting up weekly, bi-weekly or monthly recurring giving is one of the best ways to increase giving. According to [Giving Rocket](http://therocketcompany.com/giving/){:target="_blank"}, the number one indicator if a church was to surpass it’s giving goal was from having automated giving. Why? Automated giving eliminates forgetfulness, stabilizes tithing and keeps people true to their monthly pledges. If you don’t have a way to setup recurring giving in your church your missing out on the potential recurring and stabilized finances that your church could have.  


### 4.  Introduce Online & Mobile Giving 

#### Online Giving

People are spending billions in online stores such as Amazon, eBay, and iTunes. The majority of them are also doing all of their banking online. Specifically in Canada, [67% report using the internet to perform their banking tasks such as bill payments and e-transfers in the last year](http://www.cba.ca/en/media-room/50-backgrounders-on-banking-issues/125-technology-and-banking){:target="_blank"}.  Having a clearly visible giving option on your website will greatly help in allowing people to give conveniently. By setting up an easy to use donation form for one-time and recurring giving, you are bound to increase your overall church giving.

#### Mobile Giving

With more and more people carrying smartphones, having a mobile donation app will allow your congregation to give donations instantly through their smartphones. [With 19% of Canadians reporting that they used their smartphones for mobile banking last year](http://www.cba.ca/en/media-room/50-backgrounders-on-banking-issues/125-technology-and-banking){:target="_blank"}, smartphones are a great way to increase giving through current and future donations.  Allowing people to give from their smartphones also means that people can give during live events, such as conferences, seminars and offerings. This is a big benefit considering giving during offerings has decreased steadily with a cashless congregation sitting in your church.

### 5. Thank Your Givers 

Maybe one of the most important methods to increase giving is to personally thank people for what they are currently giving. Just a simple thank you during service won’t cut it. The best way is to make your gratitude personal. You could do this by sending cards, handwritten notes, small gifts, or even take them to dinner. Congratulating the givers who go above and beyond is a great way to model a cheerful giver to others as well. At the end of the day, being grateful for everything that a giver donates will go a long way in helping to maintain and increase giving in your church.
