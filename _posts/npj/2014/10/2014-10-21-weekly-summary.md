We have added a new feature to Instagive.io called Weekly Summary.

**Every Monday morning at 7:00am, you will receive an email with a PDF report of the past week's donations (from Monday to Sunday). We also include a CSV file that can be imported into your accounting software.**

The feature is designed to provide information on how much you have received to your account without having to log-in to check.

You can turn on Weekly Summary in the settings section of the admin profile. If you choose to do so, the summary will be sent out every Monday and is best used for seeing a quick overview.

In order to get a more in depth report you can log in to the admin profile, click "Filter" on your "Reports" page and view giving information via cause, date and user. After selecting the information you can then proceed to download it as a PDF or CSV file. 

The Weekly Summary update is brought to you via customer feedback. We are glad that we have the opportunity to keep making Instagive.io into a company that better serves your needs.

Look out for more updates in the coming days!
