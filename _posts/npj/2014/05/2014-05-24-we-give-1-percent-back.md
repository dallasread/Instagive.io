Instagive.io started around the idea that giving to causes should be easy. Our hope was that by creating an avenue for people to give and receive donations anytime or anywhere, we would in turn be facilitating their dreams of making a difference in the world.      

### Like you, we desire purpose
Being able to help big and small causes alike is a passion of ours and we are glad that we have an opportunity to extend that passion outside of our company walls. As a team that wants to help across the globe, we felt it was important for us to give to a cause that has a worldwide impact.

> 800 million people don't have life's most basic need - clean drinking water. Diseases from unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation kill more people every year than all forms of violence, including war.  Children are especially vulnerable, as their bodies aren't strong enough to fight diarrhea, dysentery and other illnesses. 90% of the 30,000 deaths that occur every week from unsafe water and unhygienic living conditions are in children under five years old.  The WHO reports that over 3.6% of the global disease burden can be prevented simply by improving water supply, sanitation, and hygiene. 

### Our Pledge
Channeling 100% of their funds to clean water projects, we believe they're an outstanding mission to support. With this in mind, Instagive.io will be giving 1% of our profits to **charity:water** this year.
