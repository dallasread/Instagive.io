Nathan Jansen and I have collaborated to simplify church giving. Talking with a few of our peers, here's what we've found:

They want to give in the offering, but don't always carry cash.
Spur-of-the-moment giving outside the church is difficult.
Inconsistent tithing is the result of forgetfulness, not ill-intentions.

To get our peers and churches giving again, we're building a new tool for them to give instantly online and from their mobile phone. We're currently in discussions with a few churches in the district, including Faith Sanctuary. We'd love to include your church in the project as well.

### Receive donations in your sleep!
With your customized mobile app, your members will be able to give anywhere, any time.

They will be able to set up one-time and recurring donations from their debit or credit cards. Also, an admin area where you or your staff could review transactions and issue tax receipts is included.

If you're interested in more information, have a peek at our brochure (or [Download the PDF](https://instagive.io/resources/InstagiveBrochure.pdf "Download the PDF")):

Nathan and I are just crazy enough to think that youâ€™ll even be able to increase how much people give to your church (which is good for giver & receiver).

We'll send you more information on how to sign up (quick & painless 7 minute process) when we launch the product in the coming weeks.
