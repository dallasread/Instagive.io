We've launched Instagive.io to give charities and non-profits a place where they can accept donations online, with minimal setup or maintenance. It's also a place where donors will be able to give easily, effeciently, and feel a part of the greater cause.

Instagive.io's cloud-based payments infrastructure relieves non-profits of the cost and complexity of maintaining custom payment systems. We provide reliable debit & credit card processing, receipt generation, recurring donations, and real-time analytics.

If you're interested in more information, have a peek at our brochure (or [Download the PDF](https://instagive.io/resources/InstagiveBrochure.pdf "Download the PDF")):

Ultimately, our goal is bigger:

> We're crazy enough to think that weâ€™ll be able to increase the volume (how often?) and scale (how much?) at which people give to your organization.
