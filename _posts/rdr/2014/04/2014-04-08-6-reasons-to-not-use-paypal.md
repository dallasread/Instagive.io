Paypal's great &mdash; if you just need to have a "Donate" button on your website. 

For businesses, there are *plenty* of easier-to-use, easier-to-implement options available to receive payments.

For charities, Paypal is more enticing because of their discounted rate for registered organizations ([1.9% + $0.30](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees){:target="_blank"} in Canada and [1.9% + $0.30](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees){:target="_blank"} in the US). With all their bartering power as the world leader in online payments since 1998, their rate is hard for anyone to beat. 

Unless you fully understand their offerings before you commit, choosing Paypal simply because of the low, posted rate could be hazardous down the line. What are they actually offering at this discounted rate?

#### 1. No customized app - Pay to customize

Paypal provides their own app for you to send and receive donations, but they don't offer a customized experience with your logo and branding.

For $35 per month, Paypal does offer the ability to brand your donation process. The only catch is that all coding and security considerations fall onto your lap at that point.

#### 2. Poor Administrative Tools

If you've ever used Paypal's back end for administrators, you know that it's archaic and slow to navigate. Given that it was created in 2007 (just 3 years after Facebook launched), this really doesn't come as a surprise.

Over the years, they have amassed the functionality necessary for online payment transactions... they trouble is finding the functionality when you need them.

In contrast, Instagive.io's back end is easy to navigate - it's one page. There, you can filter your transactions by Donor, Date, and Cause. Our server usually responds in less than 200ms. 

#### 3. Organization registration hassle

According to Paypal.com, signing up for Paypal to receive donations as a registered charity takes between 7 - 10 Days, though it seemed to be a little longer for [this person](http://www.ragepank.com/articles/paypal-non-profit/){:target="_blank"}.

To compare, if you [sign up](https://instagive.io/organizations/new) for Instagive.io now, you'd probably be done before you finished reading this article.

#### 4. An antiquated button

Perhaps its just me, but people seem to shutter when they see a Paypal "Donate Now" button. This is probably because the graphic was designed in 2007 - the web and it's constraints have come a long way since then. Maybe it has something to do with its history of security breaches?

#### 5. You still need your own infrastructure

Above all, you don't want donations to your organization retracted because of its Paypal landing page. So, you'll need to hire a developer and designer to build a custom giving application on your website. To receive payments online, an [SSL Certificate](https://www.symantec.com/verisign/ssl-certificates){:target="_blank"} is required. You'll also need to make sure you're [PCI Compliant](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org){:target="_blank"}. You'll need to perform [cross-browser](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org){:target="_blank", [compatibility ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Compatibility_testing){:target="_blank"}, [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing#Software_load_testing){:target="_blank"} [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Unit_testing){:target="_blank"}, [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Integration_testing){:target="_blank"}, [usability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Usability_testing){:target="_blank"}, and [acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Acceptance_testing){:target="_blank"} tests (there's more too!).

A simple giving application, while it looks simple to build, easily requires thousands of decisions to be made, secured, and tested. For a small-to-mid-sized organization, it isn't practical. For a larger organization, it makes more sense to leave their payments systems to the payment systems experts &mdash; and focus on the core of their business.

#### 6. Inability to give quickly during live events

Paypal doesn't offer a "Quick Give" option for those who don't have (and don't want) a Paypal account. It's even worse if you've forgotten the password to log in.

For live events, this is crucial. Registering a Paypal account is about a five-minute process &mdash; making it impossible for live events (if they're trying to pay attention to your event!). Instagive.io, in comparison, makes the process seamless, a quick "Quick Give" takes no more than 45 seconds &mdash; easily attainable during a "gift break".
