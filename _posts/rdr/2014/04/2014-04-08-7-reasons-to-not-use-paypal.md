Paypal's great &mdash; if you just need to have a "Donate" button on your website. 

For businesses, there are *plenty* of easier-to-use, easier-to-implement options available to receive payments.

For charities, Paypal is more enticing because of their discounted rate for registered organizations ([2.2% + $0.30](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees), hidden on their pricing page). With all their bartering power as the world leader in online payments since 1998, their rate is hard for anyone to beat. 

Unless you fully understand their offerings before you commit, choosing Paypal simply because of the posted low rate could be hazardous down the line. What are they actually offering at this discounted rate?

2. Pain in the butt admin
